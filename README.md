This repository contains a Python program for navigating a robot around the screen to draw the A&M logo using ROS2 Humble. The program utilizes a controller implemented in Python 3.8, allowing the robot to vary its linear and angular velocity to move towards specified goal coordinates.

**Overview**
The program extracts the coordinates of the A&M logo using an online image ruler and stores them in a list. During runtime, it executes the movetogoal function every 0.1 seconds. This function calculates both the distance and angle between the robotâ€™s current position and the goal coordinate it is currently moving toward. Linear and angular velocities are adjusted proportionally to the differences in magnitude of these distances and angles.
